# Train-Scheduler
## Welcome Again!
***
#### This was the first time using Materialize, and I love it. but I digress... This Train Schedualer is amazing, You yourself can add a train and watch the magic happen as it automatically calculates when the next train will arrive (moment.js) is the culprit here. I have also added a button that allows you to sign in with Google! When you add a train it goes to the firebase database then appends to the table, I have added a button on each row that allows you to remove the table row, not only from the page but from the database also! This was a fun assignment, especially because I got to learn moment.js *AND* Materialize, which once again I **LOVE** 

### Technologies used:
